## 2024-05-21 - [Timezone Shift & Performance: Local Date Formatting]
**Learning:** Using `new Date(...).toISOString().split('T')[0]` for local date formatting in JavaScript loops introduces a timezone shift bug (since it converts to UTC before extracting the string) and has significant performance overhead due to object allocation and string parsing.
**Action:** Use manual string concatenation and manual formatting to pad and format the year, month, and day based on local time. This avoids creating unnecessary Date instances inside loops and prevents timezone shifting errors.
## 2026-06-17 - [Date Formatting Overhead]
**Learning:** `Date.prototype.toLocaleDateString()` has severe performance overhead (~25-100x slower) compared to array lookups and simple string splitting. Using it inside frequently rendered components (like Calendar grids) causes unnecessary main-thread blocking.
**Action:** Prefer pre-computed array lookups for weekdays/months when formatting dates locally, especially in loops.

## 2024-05-22 - [Performance: Fast Date Sorting]
**Learning:** To optimize JavaScript performance, prefer direct string comparison (e.g., `a.date < b.date ? -1 : a.date > b.date ? 1 : 0`) over parsing into `Date` objects when sorting arrays by ISO 8601 formatted date strings.
**Action:** Always use string comparison for standard YYYY-MM-DD format sorting instead of `new Date().getTime()`, as it avoids significant object allocation overhead.
## 2026-07-20 - [Date Allocation Overhead in Loops]
**Learning:** Rendering calendar components (like CalendarGrid and CalendarDay) using repeated `new Date()` allocations inside loops or `useMemo` hooks per day causes significant main-thread blocking and garbage collection overhead.
**Action:** When computing daily attributes (like weekday formatting), pass down the current month context, calculate the first day of the week once or use arithmetic modulo, and use fast array lookups instead of instantiating `new Date()` instances in loops.
